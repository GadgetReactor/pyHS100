Changelog
=========

0.3.0 (2017-09-14)
------------------

This is the first release after a while and aims to improve the robustness all-around.
To make this happen we have decided to break the API and drop the support for Python 2.

API break:
    * Python2 support has been dropped.
    * pyHS100/pyHS100.py has been splitted to smartdevice.py, smartplug.py and smartbulb.py, no one should have ever accessed these directly though.
    * SmartPlugException is no more, SmartDeviceException is used by both SmartPlug and SmartBulb
    * Discovery has been moved from TPLinkSmartHomeProtocol into its own class for easier 3rd party use.
    * SmartDevice's identify() and `features` will emit a warning when used. These will likely be dropped or revised in the future and their use should be avoided.

Other changes:

    * CLI tool supports device discovery and is usable without specifying device type or IP for testing
    * CLI tool supports changing bulb-specific settings
    * Library support & unit tests are extended to cover more devices.
       - Supported plugs: HS100, HS105, HS110
       - Supported switches: HS200
       - Supported bulbs: LB100, LB110, LB120, LB130

- Discover refactoring, enhancements to the cli tool (#71) [Teemu R]

  * Discover refactoring, enhancements to the cli tool

  * Discover tries to detect the type of the device from sysinfo response
  * Discover.discover() returns an IP address keyed dictionary,
    values are initialized instances of the automatically detected device type.

  * When no IP is given, autodetect all supported devices and print out their states
  * When only IP but no type is given, autodetect type and make a call based on that information.
    * One can define --bulb or --plug to skip the detection.

  * renamed pyHS100.py -> smartdevice.py

  * SmartPlugException -> SmartDeviceException in comments

  * fix mic_type check

  * make time() return None on failure as we don't know which devices support getting the time and it's used in the cli tool

  * hw_info: check if key exists before accessing it, add mic_mac and mic_type

  * Check for mic_mac on mac, based on work by kdschloesser on issue #59

  * make hound happy, __init__ on SmartDevice cannot error out so removing 'raises' documentation

- Generalize smartdevice class and add bulb support for the cli tool (#50) [Teemu R]

  Fixes #48 and #51. The basic functionality should work on all types of supported devices, for bulb specific commands it is currently necessary to specify ```--bulb```.
  
- Refactor and drop py2 support (#49) [Teemu R]

  * move is_off property to SmartDevice, implement is_on for bulb and use it

  * refactor by moving smartbulb and smartplug to their own classes

  * travis: remove 2.7, add 3.6

0.2.4.2 (2017-04-08)
--------------------
- Add installation requirement for future package. [Teemu Rytilahti]

0.2.4.1 (2017-03-26)
--------------------
- Cli: display an error if no ip is given. [Teemu Rytilahti]


0.2.4 (2017-03-26)
------------------

- Add new client tool (#42) [Teemu R]

  * Add new client tool

  After installing the package pyhs100 command-line tool can be used
  to control the plug.

  See --help for its usage, most of the features for plugs are implemented,
  some of the shared functionality works for bulbs too.

  * Add discover command

  * Delete old examples, the cli works as an example well enough

- Ignore OSError on socket.shutdown() [Teemu Rytilahti]

  This fixes #22 and obsoletes PR #23.
- Set color temp to 0 when trying to change color (#36) [pete1450]

  * set color temp to 0 when trying to change color

  * changed tabs to spaces

- Add changelog & add .gitchangelog.rc (#28) [Teemu R]

  This commits adds .gitchangelog.rc for changelog generation.
  To generate, simply run gitchangelog.

- Discover: Catch socket.timeout and debug log it (#34) [Teemu R]

  Fixes #33

- Add flake8 to tox, disable qa on pyHS100/__init__.py, fix py27
  compatibility (#31) [Teemu R]

- Add support for TP-Link smartbulbs (#30) [Matthew Garrett]

  * Add support for new-style protocol

  Newer devices (including my LB130) seem to include the request length in
  the previously empty message header, and ignore requests that lack it. They
  also don't send an empty packet as the final part of a response, which can
  lead to hangs. Add support for this, with luck not breaking existing devices
  in the process.

  * Fix tests

  We now include the request length in the encrypted packet header, so strip
  the header rather than assuming that it's just zeroes.

  * Create a SmartDevice parent class

  Add a generic SmartDevice class that SmartPlug can inherit from, in
  preparation for adding support for other device types.

  * Add support for TP-Link smartbulbs

  These bulbs use the same protocol as the smart plugs, but have additional
  commands for controlling bulb-specific features. In addition, the bulbs
  have their emeter under a different target and return responses that
  include the energy unit in the key names.

  * Add tests for bulbs

  Not entirely comprehensive, but has pretty much the same level of testing
  as plugs


0.2.3 (2017-01-11)
------------------

- Add .gitchnagelog.rc for changelog generation. to generate, simply
  install and run gitchangelog. [Teemu Rytilahti]

- Version bump. [GadgetReactor]

- Initial steps to remove caching (#26) [Teemu R]

  This commit removes caching of sysinfo to avoid
  inconsistent states as described in issue #14.

  Each an every access for properties will cause a request
  to be made to the device. To avoid this, user of the library
  may want to access sys_info() directly instead of using the helpers.

  Currently sys_info() returns raw json object where-as helpers do
  parse information for easier consumption; current state is just to
  provide a PoC how it looks compared to having an active update()
  for fetching the info.

- Make tests runnable without device (#24) [Teemu R]

  * Make tests runnable without device

  Adds preliminary support for fake devices, thanks to
  hoveeman's sysinfos from issue #14,
  making running tests possible without a device.

  At the moment we have only HS110 and HS200 infos available, and tests
  are currently run only against HS110 data.

  * Make tests py27 compatible

- Add device discovery (#25) [Teemu R]

  * add (untested) discover mode

  * Keep discovery and normal communication separate, uppercase magic consts

  This sepearates the earlier test code for discovering devices,
  and adds 5 sec timeout for gathering responses from potential devices.

  This commit also uppercases magic constants.

  Discovery & communication tested with HS110.

  * update readme with example how to discover devices, pep8ify

- Add timeout to query (#19) [Austin]

- Refactor & add unittests for almost all functionality, add tox for
  running tests on py27 and py35 (#17) [Teemu R]

  * Refactor & add unittests for almost all functionality, add tox for running tests on py27 and py35

  This commit adds unit tests for current api functionality.
  - currently no mocking, all tests are run on the device.
  - the library is now compatible with python 2.7 and python 3.5, use tox for tests
  - schema checks are done with voluptuous

  refactoring:
  - protocol is separated into its own file, smartplug adapted to receive protocol worker as parameter.
  - cleaned up the initialization routine, initialization is done on use, not on creation of smartplug
  - added model and features properties, identity kept for backwards compatibility
  - no more storing of local variables outside _sys_info, paves a way to handle state changes sanely (without complete reinitialization)

  * Fix CI warnings, remove unused leftover code

  * Rename _initialize to _fetch_sysinfo, as that's what it does.

  * examples.cli: fix identify call, prettyprint sysinfo, update readme which had false format for led setting

  * Add tox-travis for automated testing.

0.2.2 (2016-12-13)
------------------

- Version bump (#16) [Georgi Kirichkov]

- Read all data from the device, disable double-encoding, implement more
  APIs, refactor querying, update README (#11) [Teemu R]

  * Read from socket until no data available, disable double string encoding

  HS110 sends sometimes datagrams in chunks especially for get_daystat,
  this patch makes it to read until there is no more data to be read.

  As json.dumps() does JSON encoding already, there's no need to str()
  the year or month either.

  * Add cli.py, a simple script to query devices for debugging purposes.

  * allow easier importing with from pyHS100 import SmartPlug

  * move cli.py to examples, add short usage into README.md

  * Implement more available APIs, refactor querying code.

  This commit adds access to new properties, both read & write,  while keeping the old one (mostly) intact.
  Querying is refactored to be done inside _query_helper() method,
  which unwraps results automatically and rises SmartPlugException() in case of errors.
  Errors are to be handled by clients.

  New features:
  * Setting device alias (plug.alias = "name")
  * led read & write
  * icon read (doesn't seem to return anything without cloud support at least), write API is not known, throws an exception currently
  * time read (returns datetime), time write implemented, but not working even when no error is returned from the device
  * timezone read
  * mac read & write, writing is untested for now.

  Properties for easier access:
  * hw_info: return hw-specific elements from sysinfo
  * on_since: pretty-printed from sysinfo
  * location: latitude and longitued from sysinfo
  * rssi: rssi from sysinfo

  * Update README.md with examples of available features.

  * Handle comments from mweinelt

  * Refactor state handling, use booleans instead of strings

  * Fix issues raised during the review.

  Following issues are addressed by this commit:
  * All API is more or less commented (including return types, exceptions, ..)
  * Converted state to use
  * Added properties is_on, is_off for those who don't want to check against strings.
  * Handled most issues reported by pylint.
  * Adjusted _query_helper() to strip off err_code from the result object.
  * Fixed broken format() syntax for string formattings.

  * Fix ci woes plus one typo.

  * Do initialization after changing device properties, fix nits.
