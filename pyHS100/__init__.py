"""
This module provides a way to interface with TP-Link's smart home devices,
such as smart plugs (HS1xx), wall switches (HS2xx), and light bulbs (LB1xx).

All common, shared functionalities are available through `SmartDevice` class::

    x = SmartDevice("192.168.1.1")
    print(x.sys_info)

For device type specific actions `SmartBulb` or `SmartPlug` must be used instead.

Module-specific errors are raised as `SmartDeviceException` and are expected
to be handled by the user of the library.
